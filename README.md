# Smart-Toll-Collecting-System
It is an automatic system which leverages the IOT technology to identify a vehicle via a unique identification tag. 
We have used RFID tag in this case. 
When a vehicle passes through a toll booth, this RFID card is used to track & bill the vehicle owner through a payment gateway.
